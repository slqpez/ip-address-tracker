# IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)



A simple web application that by entering an IP address, shows the location on the map, as well as other data.


It was a challenge found on the page [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/),
Therefore, the idea and the design belong to them. 

To get the IP Address locations, i used [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/).    

To generate the map, i used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/), with [React-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).


For initial project setup i used [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
